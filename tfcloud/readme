The objective of this lab is offer an introduction to the tools Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise. Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise are different distributions of the same application.

Terraform Cloud is "software as a service" (a website on the internet), and Terraform Enterprise is the same software, only self-hosted. Regardless of the name, the goals are:

Helps teams use Terraform together
Runs Terraform in a controlled space
Easy access to shared state and secrets
Access controls for approving changes to infrastructure
The software is available "as a service", by visiting https://app.terraform.io. There is a free tier which this lab explores. Paid tiers are described on the website, but will allow features like collaboration with more than five users, setting permission levels for teams, the ability to enforce policies before creating infrastructure, e.g. more collaboration tools.
